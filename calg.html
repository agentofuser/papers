<p>Functional programmins is universaly understood as <em>applicative</em> programming: an extension of the lambda calculus, based on application and variable binding. But this not the only way. There's an alternative approach in functional programming, named <em>concatenative programing</em>, which is based on the function composition and a set of basic combinators.</p>
<p>This paper introduces the algebra of two operations (composition and concatenation) as the way to define concatenative programming. The algebra provides an elegant and powerful way to combine functions without variables, which is, unlike point-free programming in applicative languages, is easy and straighforward to use.</p>
<p>The algebra has various useful properties that allow to introduce novel features into concatenative programming, like pattern matching. This paper shows this properties without describing a way to use them.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Concatenative languages are often described as <em>stack-based</em> languages. This is not quite correct: concatenative languages are not necessary based on the stack.</p>
